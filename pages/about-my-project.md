subtitle: Water Contamination Detection Using AI
project_title: "Water Contamination Detection Using AI"

problem: |
  The level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. PHGs are set by the California Environmental Protection Agency.
  Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level.

  This project seeks to explore common sources of contamination: industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, sewage. We are providing a general overview of water quality issues and the potential of AI in solving them.

approach: |
  Dive into the core topic: using AI to improve water quality monitoring.
  Include:
  - AI techniques (e.g., machine learning, neural networks, anomaly detection)
  - Real-time data processing from sensors
  - Case studies and research findings:
    - "Laboratory Development of an AI System..."
    - "Real-time Water Quality Monitoring using AI-enabled sensors" (ScienceDirect)
    - "Applications of IoT and AI in Water Quality Monitoring" (IEEE)
    - "Smart Water Quality Monitoring with IoT Wireless Sensor Networks"

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, we hope to develop a real-time water quality monitoring system using sensors, analyze collected data with AI models, and contribute to optimizing contamination detection algorithms for accurate predictions, thereby advancing the body of research on AI-driven solutions for environmental monitoring and water safety.
