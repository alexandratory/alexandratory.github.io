  Today, I focused on testing the turbidity sensor to measure water clarity and integrating it with the ESP32 on the breadboard. I learned how turbidity sensors work by measuring the amount of light scattered in water, which increases with the presence of particles. Testing with clean and murky water provided a practical understanding of how the sensor translates real-world conditions into analog data.  
  One of the key challenges was ensuring accurate readings. Despite stable wiring, the turbidity sensor data fluctuated, likely due to calibration issues or environmental factors like light interference. This reinforced the importance of creating controlled testing conditions for reliable results.  
  I also practiced memorizing wire placements on the breadboard for both the turbidity and pH sensors. Understanding how to systematically connect the power, ground, and signal pins helped me build confidence in working with multiple sensors simultaneously.

The turbidity sensor produced fluctuating values that didn’t always align with the expected results for clean versus murky water. Adjusting the code and recalibrating the sensor partially improved the accuracy, but additional tuning is required.  
Remembering and managing wire placements for two sensors on the same breadboard was initially confusing. Misplaced connections caused some interruptions, emphasizing the need for careful organization and labeling.  
Testing in an open space introduced external light, which may have affected the turbidity sensor’s performance. Shielding the sensor from ambient light is a potential solution.

  Testing the turbidity sensor was a fascinating yet challenging experience. working with sensors, from calibration to environmental influences. Despite the fluctuating data, the process of analyzing clean and murky water readings provided valuable insights into how turbidity is measured and interpreted.  
  Working with the breadboard was a great opportunity to reinforce my understanding of circuit layout. Memorizing wire placements felt tedious but was an essential step toward building a reliable multi-sensor system. Today’s hands-on tasks reminded me that small details, like consistent wiring and controlled testing environments, play a significant role in ensuring successful outcomes.
