what_i_learned: |  
  Today, I learned how to connect the ESP32 to different computers, including Windows, and install the necessary drivers to make it work. It took some troubleshooting because the ESP32 wasn’t being recognized at first, but I figured it out by changing the port and updating the drivers. This taught me how to handle connection issues with microcontrollers.  
  I also worked on understanding the components and functions of different sensors used in water quality monitoring. For the turbidity sensor, I studied how it measures water clarity using light scattering and why calibration is so important for accurate readings. The pH sensor uses electrodes to measure acidity levels, and dissolved oxygen sensors use optical or electrochemical methods to detect oxygen in water. Heavy metal sensors identify toxic metals using techniques like spectroscopy, and temperature sensors monitor changes in water conditions. Learning about how these sensors work and how to calibrate them helped me see how they all fit into a monitoring system.  
  I spent time practicing wiring the ESP32 to the breadboard, making sure I understood how to connect each sensor. Memorizing the layout of the breadboard and ESP32 pins is getting easier with practice.  
  Finally, I worked on fixing an issue with the turbidity sensor code. There was a mistake in the code, so the readings weren’t accurate, and I spent time troubleshooting that.  

blockers: |  
The ESP32 wasn’t being detected at first, and I had to troubleshoot by updating drivers and switching ports.  
The turbidity sensor code still has some bugs, making it hard to get reliable readings.  
Memorizing all the connections on the breadboard is tricky and takes time to get right.  

reflection: |  
  Today was a mix of learning and problem-solving. I’m glad I learned how to troubleshoot the ESP32 connection and understand more about the sensors we’re using. Even though fixing the turbidity code was frustrating, it helped me realize how small mistakes can affect the whole system. Working on the presentation also reminded me of how far I’ve come in understanding these sensors and how to explain them to others. I feel more confident in handling these challenges as I keep improving.
