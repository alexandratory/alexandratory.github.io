what_i_learned: |  
  Today, my team and I made progress by adding the TBD sensor to our project. We integrated it into the existing setup and amde sure the wiring and connections were stable. Testing the sensor helped us understand how it supports the turbidity and pH sensors in collecting more water quality data.  
  We also began working on a test demo for Firebase to simulate real-time data uploads from our sensors. Setting up Firebase allowed us to explore how data flows from the ESP32 to the cloud, making the system more dynamic and user-friendly. The demo gave us insight into how our project can be used for remote monitoring.  
  Additionally, we updated our presentation slides. We refined the content to include recent developments like the Firebase integration and sensor updates. The visuals were also improved to make the information clearer and more engaging. This exercise helped us focus on explaining our work in a simple and impactful way.  

blockers: |  
  - Integrating the TBD sensor with the breadboard was tricky because of limited space, requiring us to reorganize connections.  
  - Firebase configuration took time, as we had to troubleshoot minor issues with linking the ESP32 to the database.  
  - Updating the slides to reflect the latest progress took longer than expected as we wanted to make the design consistent.  

reflection: |  
  Adding the TBD sensor was a meaningful step, as it expanded the scope of our water quality monitoring system. It was exciting to see how all the sensors work together to provide more accurate data. Starting the Firebase test demo made the project feel more real, showing how it could be applied in practical situations.  
  Updating the presentation slides was a good opportunity to reflect on our progress and focus on how to communicate our ideas effectively. The process of improving the visuals and streamlining the content reminded me of how much we’ve accomplished so far. Despite the challenges, today’s work brought us closer to a more complete and polished project.
