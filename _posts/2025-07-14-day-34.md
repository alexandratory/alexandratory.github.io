what_i_learned: |  
  Today, I learned how to create a basic website using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). I wrote CSS code and used Tailwind CSS to help style the page more easily. I practiced changing font styles, background colors, and button effects.  
  I also used `http://localhost:5173/` to view the website live in my browser as I worked. It helped me see my changes right away. I learned how to organize the layout using Flexbox and how Tailwind simplifies a lot of styling.  
  This experience helped me understand how web design connects with what users actually see and click. I felt more confident using HTML and CSS and learned how to make pages that look clean and modern.

blockers: |  
  At first, I had trouble getting Tailwind to show up correctly on the page. It took a few tries to check if it was installed and linked properly.  
  It was also a little confusing using the terminal and localhost setup, but I got the hang of it after following the setup steps.

reflection: |  
  I really enjoyed designing something visual today. Learning how websites are built from the ground up made me more excited about coding. Using Tailwind made it easier to create a nice layout without writing a lot of custom CSS.  
  This skill will be helpful for our final project if we decide to build a dashboard or display the sensor data online. I'm proud that I was able to get a working webpage up and running.
