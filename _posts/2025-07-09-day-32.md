what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on setting up Firebase correctly with Arduino. I went into the Firebase project settings and copied the project ID. Then I created a new user to match the test user from our code, which made the connection work better. I also double-checked all the pin numbers in the code to make sure they matched the wiring on the breadboard.

  In Arduino, I downloaded new ESP32 board files by importing a new URL under Preferences. This gave me more board options that worked better with my setup. Changing the board type helped reduce errors during uploading.

  I also learned how to use Estero, a tool that helps with research papers. It was helpful for organizing sources and writing in a more structured way. I plan to use it more when we continue working on our research section for the project.

blockers: |
  At first, some ESP32 boards didn’t show up properly in Arduino, and I had to retry the download and restart the IDE. Connecting the Firebase test user also took time because the settings had to match exactly.

reflection: |
  Today helped me better understand how to set up Firebase and troubleshoot board settings in Arduino. It felt good to solve the errors and get a cleaner connection between the code and the hardware. Learning Estero also gave me a new tool to use when writing papers or organizing my thoughts for research. Overall, I felt more prepared and confident with the system and tools.
