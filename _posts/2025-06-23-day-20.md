  Today, I worked on integrating the Gravity Analog pH Sensor Meter Kit with the ESP32. Using the DFRobot library, I attempted to calibrate the sensor by sending commands like `Cal pH` and `Exit pH` via the serial monitor. This process taught me how pH sensors translate voltage readings into pH values and how calibration fine-tunes this translation.  
  I learned that the sensor’s voltage-to-pH relationship is not universal, and the default formula in the library required adjustments to match my sensor’s behavior. This involved analyzing stable voltage readings from the sensor (e.g., ~1.371V for pH 7) and recalculating the conversion factors.  
  Additionally, I explored troubleshooting steps for ESP32 connection issues in the Arduino IDE, such as switching USB ports, updating drivers, and selecting the correct board configuration.

blockers: |  
  - **ESP32 Upload Errors:** Encountered several errors (e.g., `dfu-util: No DFU capable USB device available`). This required checking the USB connection, changing ports, and updating board drivers in the Arduino IDE.  
  - **Calibration Issues:** The calibration commands (`Cal pH`, `Exit pH`) didn’t produce accurate results. Stable voltage readings confirmed the hardware was functioning, but the default conversion formula needed recalibration to reflect the sensor’s actual output.  
  - **Library Execution:** The DFRobot library commands initially didn’t respond well, likely due to timing issues or incorrect execution procedures.

  Today’s work reinforced the importance of understanding both hardware and software when integrating sensors. Debugging the ESP32 connection taught me to isolate and address errors, which improved my confidence in working with microcontrollers.  
  Adjusting the pH formula highlighted the importance of calibration and knowing how different sensors behave under real-world conditions. Although the process was challenging, it was rewarding to see the system gradually become more accurate. This experience reminded me that trial and error is a part of building reliable systems.
