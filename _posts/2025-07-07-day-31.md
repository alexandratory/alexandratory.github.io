what_i_learned: |
  Today we made a lot of progress. My team and I worked on getting all the sensors fully connected on the breadboard. We labeled the wires to make sure nothing gets mixed up. I also helped update the Firebase so it shows live sensor data clearly and cleanly.

  We worked on the look of the interface, trying to make it easier for anyone to read and understand. I also learned how to set privacy rules in Firebase so the data is more protected. We talked about why it's important to be careful with sensor data, because wrong numbers could confuse people or give false info about water safety.

  We haven’t done our final presentation yet, but everything we’ve built is now coming together. It feels good to see the system almost ready.

blockers: |
  We had some trouble getting good readings from the lead and TDS sensors. The numbers were off at first, and we had to go back and fix the calibration. Firebase also had some small connection issues at the start, but we figured it out.

reflection: |
  I feel proud of the progress we made today. I understand the system more and how everything connects. Working with my team helped me stay focused and get more done. Even though we had some issues, we fixed them together. I’m excited to see how it all works during our presentation.
