what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about taking what we learned from TinkerCAD simulations and applying it to real-world components. My team and I received the Arduino kits and breadboards video practes and studied how they operate. We started assembling circuits based on the designs we practiced. Connecting the components physically was a bit challenging at first, especially ensuring the wires and pins were placed correctly, but it was a great learning experience. We also experimented with coding simple programs to control LEDs and measure input from sensors. This hands-on application helped me understand the concepts more deeply and feel more confident in troubleshooting issues.

blockers: |
  The only blocker we faced was a minor issue with loose connections on the breadboard, but it was quickly resolved by re-checking our setup. The tinker Cad was a big help in this process. We used the Website and applied the videos to it. It was great to see everything connect and it made it more simple for all of us. The videos out mentors provided and the ones we found were really interesting and helpful.

reflection: |
  Transitioning from simulations to physical components is exciting and rewarding. It feels like weve accomplished alot when it it comes to learning from videos and simulations. Seeing a circuit light up or respond to input after careful assembly and coding was very encouraging for our team to see. It made all the research and preparation feel worthwhile. I also appreciated how well my team worked together to solve problems and share insights. Tomorrow, I plan to practice more advanced circuits and refine my coding skills to handle more complex projects.
