what_i_learned: |
  Today we deployed our local Vite-based project to Vercel, which gave us a live public URL that we can use for demoing our smart water dashboard. It was exciting to see our work leave the localhost and become accessible online.

  I also worked on the script for our elevator pitch and practiced it out loud with the team. We made sure it was clear, concise, and targeted to both technical and non-technical audiences. Delivering it out loud helped us gain confidence and fine-tune the timing.

  Lastly, we attempted to connect Firebase data directly to the deployed site. Although there were still a few bugs in syncing the real-time data, we started testing how sensor values could appear dynamically on the dashboard.

goals_of_the_day: |
  - Deploy our website to Vercel for public access and sharing.
  - Create and execute a strong elevator pitch for the project.
  - Start connecting Firebase to the deployed site for real-time updates.
  - Test dashboard responsiveness and layout in the live version.

blockers: |
  - We had some issues making sure Firebase credentials were secure in the deployed version.
  - Syncing the real-time database with the deployed site had some lag or missing values.
  - Adapting the UI for different screen sizes in Vercel revealed a few layout bugs.

reflection: |
  Having the site live on Vercel made everything feel more real—we're finally seeing our project in action outside our development environment. Practicing the elevator pitch gave me a better understanding of how to communicate our goals clearly and with confidence. Although there are still some technical challenges with Firebase integration, it’s coming together. We’re almost at the finish line!
