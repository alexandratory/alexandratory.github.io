what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned a lot about computer vision. I learned that for models to accurately understand and interpret visual data, they require a substantial amount of data and examples. This reinforced the importance of quality datasets in training machine learning models.

  I also learned about an image classification model using Teachable Machine, which provided a hands-on introduction to how computer vision models work. The process involved training a model to recognize specific images, demonstrating how visual patterns are detected and classified by machine learning systems.

  I participated in the Python 101 breakout room, where I learned about Python's ability to automatically convert between `int` and `float` data types during operations. I gained an understanding of type casting, a concept that involves converting one data type into another, such as from a string to an integer. These insights not only improved my Python skills but also deepened my appreciation for how programming languages handle data types efficiently.

blockers: |
  No blockers were encountered today. The learning process was smooth.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to gain a deeper understanding of Git and how it simplifies version control and collaboration. Additionally, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about image classification models using Teachable Machine. This hands-on experience highlighted the applications of machine learning in computer vision, making the day both educational and inspiring. It was really cool to see what everyone came up with using AI. I’m looking forward to building on this knowledge and exploring more advanced topics in the future.
