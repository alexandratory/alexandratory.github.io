## What I Learned

Today we kept working on connecting the Arduino IDE to Firebase to show real-time sensor data from our ESP32. We’re still troubleshooting the connection so that it updates live on our dashboard, but we're getting closer.

In the afternoon, the whole cohort joined a workshop on drone technology and muscle movement tracking. We learned about using sensor stacks to control drones through arm movements, and how AI and real-time systems can be combined for robotics. It was really interesting to see how these concepts connect with what we’re doing in our own IoT project.

## Goals of the Day

- Keep testing and debugging the Arduino-to-Firebase connection.
- Learn about muscle sensors and drone control systems in the workshop.
- Explore how sensor stacks can be used for AI and robotics.

## Reflection

Even though Firebase gave us a bit of trouble, the workshop gave us fresh ideas and motivation. It reminded me how much potential our own tech has — especially when you connect physical sensors with smart systems. Excited to finish the integration soon and show our full setup live.
