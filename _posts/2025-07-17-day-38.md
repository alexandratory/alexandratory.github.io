  Today, We started with a Research writing workshop. I worked on building the user interface for our water quality monitoring project. Using Tailwind CSS inside VS Code, I created basic layouts, button designs, and made sure the look and feel matched our project’s theme. This UI will be used to show real-time water data collected from sensors.

  I also finalized the “Methodology” section of our research paper. I explained the tools we used (like ESP32 and Firebase), how we collected and cleaned data, and how machine learning helps classify water quality. Writing this helped me better understand the full process.

  I found a new dataset on Kaggle with cleaner and more realistic water quality values (pH, turbidity, TDS, etc.). After exploring a few messy CSVs, I finally chose one that made more sense for our model training. I practiced cleaning this data in Colab by converting to numeric, filling in missing values, and setting up input (X) and output (y) variables for Random Forest training.

  I successfully connected additional Firebase accounts to our ESP32 boards. Now, multiple sensors can send live data into different databases, which will help us simulate various water sources in real-time. I also spent time understanding the Python function that loads and prepares this data.

blockers: |
  - Learning Tailwind CSS was challenging at first, especially the layout system.
  - Some Kaggle files were inconsistent or incomplete, which slowed down testing.
  - The Python code for loading and preparing data took time to understand fully.

reflection: |
  I’m starting to see how all the pieces—web design, Firebase, sensors, and machine learning—connect together. It’s exciting to see our system taking shape. I feel more confident using CSS tools, and working with real datasets helped me appreciate the importance of clean data. Connecting our work to a real interface makes everything feel more tangible and useful.
