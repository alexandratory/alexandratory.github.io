what_i_learned: |
I learned about Git and GitHub and their distinct roles in the development process. Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and maintain a detailed history of their project. It helps teams to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's work, because of its branching and merging capabilities.
GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git. It is a interface for hosting and managing Git repositories in the cloud. GitHub is commonly used for collaborative projects, enabling developers to share their code. GitHub also supports features like issue tracking, project management tools, and community engagement through its social networking features. Together, Git and GitHub empower developers to work efficiently and collaboratively on software development projects.

My computer's runtime was noticeably slow, which made working on my project more challenging. The delays often disrupted my workflow and added frustration to the debugging process. On top of that, I kept encountering YAML errors, which were frustrating because they interrupted the functionality of my code and made troubleshooting more time-consuming.
The YAML errors were due to issues like incorrect indentation, missing colons, or improperly formatted keys and values. Since YAML is very sensitive to syntax, even a small mistake could result in errors that were not always easy to identify at first glance. Combined with the slow runtime, resolving these issues became a hard process. Its fine though because challenges taught me the importance of careful attention to detail, particularly when working with sensitive file formats like YAML. 
reflection: |
 It was exciting to dive into learning about Git and gain a deeper understanding of GitHub. Initially, I thought these tools might be complex, becuase i only ever put the details of my projects in the folders and never really took the time to learn the platform but I found them surprisingly easy to grasp. Git provided me with a clear understanding of how developers collaborate seamlessly on code. I like how i can code without the fear of losing progress. Exploring GitHub was exciting aswell. I discovered how it allows developers to host repositories online, review each other’s work, and propose changes through pull requests. I like how GitHub serves as both a technical tool for developers and a platform for sharing knowledge and engaging with a global community of creators. This experience opened my eyes to the importance of collaboration in software development. I love the way it was taught aswell it was really easy to understand.
