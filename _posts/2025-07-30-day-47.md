what_i_learned: |
  Today we officially recorded our demo video, walking through the full functionality of our IoT system. It was rewarding to present our sensor integration, Firebase connectivity, and live dashboard in a clean and cohesive way. I gained more confidence in clearly explaining the system and realized the importance of practicing delivery.

  We also finalized our slide deck for the final presentation. Everyone contributed to making sure each section flowed well and aligned with the visuals. Practicing our delivery as a team helped us sync transitions and build momentum going into the final presentation.

blockers: |
  - Timing our speech during the demo recording took some trial and error.
  - Small formatting inconsistencies in the slides required last-minute fixes.

reflection: |
  Seeing the full demo come together made all the hard work worth it. Presenting and practicing with the team helped me better understand not just my part, but how everything fits together. I’m feeling more prepared and excited for the final showcase tomorrow.
