what_i_learned: |
  Today, our team completed the PowerPoint for our final presentation. We worked together to make sure the slides clearly told the story of our project, highlighting our key data, challenges, and solutions. I helped create the demo video that explains our breadboard setup and how the sensors connect to the ESP32. This visual helped us break down the hardware in a simple, easy-to-follow way for our audience.

  Through this process, I learned the importance of balancing technical details with visuals that make the project easy to understand. Working on the demo video also helped me practice explaining our setup in a way that makes sense to people who aren’t familiar with the hardware.

blockers: |
  - It was sometimes hard to align everyone’s schedules to finish the PowerPoint and demo video on time.
  - We had to revise the video several times to make sure our explanation was clear for people without a technical background.

reflection: |
  Finishing the PowerPoint and the demo video felt like a great way to bring all our work together. I realized that an effective presentation isn’t just about showing the data — it’s about telling the story in a way people can follow and connect with. I really enjoyed making the demo video because it gave me the chance to walk through the breadboard and ESP32 setup step-by-step. It made the technical parts of our project more approachable and fun to explain.
