## What I Learned

Today we built and deployed a real-time web dashboard to display live sensor data from our water quality monitoring system. We used Tailwind CSS to create a clean and responsive layout, and JavaScript to make the dashboard dynamic. The dashboard connects directly to our Firebase Realtime Database, which receives updates every 10 seconds from our ESP32 microcontroller.

We set up real-time listeners using Firebase’s JavaScript SDK so that the dashboard automatically updates without needing to refresh. Each parameter—pH, turbidity, TDS, and temperature—is displayed in a card layout with color-coded values and live status labels, making the data easy to understand at a glance.

## Goals of the Day

- Build a responsive real-time dashboard using Tailwind CSS and JavaScript
- Connect the dashboard to Firebase Realtime Database
- Display live sensor data from the ESP32
- Add real-time data listening and automatic updates
- Improve readability with color-coded values and status indicators

## Blockers

- Some Firebase keys had to be reconfigured for security
- Layout bugs on mobile view required extra tweaking with Tailwind
- Debugging JavaScript listeners to ensure no data was skipped

## Reflection

Seeing our data update in real time felt like a big milestone. This dashboard is the final layer that connects everything—hardware, cloud, and user interface. It’s user-friendly, works across devices, and gives instant insight into water quality. We're getting really close to completing the full system!
