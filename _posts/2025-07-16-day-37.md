what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned how machine learning actually works with our water sensor data. We looked at how real values like pH, turbidity, temperature, and TDS can be collected, cleaned, and turned into a dataset that helps a computer learn what “safe” and “unsafe” water looks like.

  I saw how each sensor reading is stored and organized in a DataFrame, which is just a big table that helps us run machine learning on the data. I also learned how features like time of day, weather, and rainfall can help the model understand the environment better.

  We also talked about data cleaning—like how we remove outliers (bad readings) and apply filters so small sensor glitches don’t mess up our results. We normalize everything too, which just means we make sure all values are on a similar scale so the model isn’t confused.

  There was a code example that created sample data if no real file existed, and it helped us see what a full dataset looks like before training a model. This included calculating if the water was “Good,” “Fair,” or “Poor.”

  Lastly, I learned how this connects to the data we’ll get from our own device, and how we can plug our readings into this same system. In the future, our ESP32 data will follow this exact process to predict water safety in real time.

blockers: |
  - Some of the code still looks complex at first, so it took time to break it down line by line.
  - It’s tricky remembering what each cleaning method does (like filters vs. scaling).
  - I want more practice turning raw sensor readings into working datasets.

reflection: |
  Today helped me understand the full picture of how real-world data becomes something useful. We don’t just collect numbers—we clean them, organize them, and use them to teach a computer how to make decisions. It’s cool to know that our project could really help someone know if their water is safe. I feel more confident working with real data now, and I’m excited to try it with our own device next.
