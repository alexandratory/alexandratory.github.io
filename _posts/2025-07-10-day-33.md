what_i_learned: |
  Today we went to a workshop where we learned how to write in a way that keeps readers interested. We talked about how to make articles more engaging and why it’s important to have a strong abstract. I learned that the abstract is like a mini version of your whole project — it needs to tell people what the project is about, why it matters, and what the results are. We thought about how this could help our contamination project so more people understand what we’re doing and why it’s useful.

  After the workshop, we continued preparing our data for machine learning. We used a method called `train_test_split` to divide our data into two parts:
  - The **training set**, which helps the computer learn
  - The **testing set**, which checks how well it learned

  Then we used `StandardScaler`, which makes sure all our data is on the same scale. It’s like resizing big and small numbers so the computer doesn’t get confused — like shrinking a dinosaur and stretching a toy car to the same size.

  Learning about these steps helped us get our data ready for training our AI model. It made me realize that clean, prepared data is just as important as the model itself.

  Understanding how scaling changes data without losing meaning was confusing at first. It took a few examples to get the idea. Also, explaining our project in simple words during the workshop was harder than I expected.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed today because I got to work on both writing and technical skills. The workshop helped me think about how to make our project clearer for different types of people. The data prep also reminded me how important it is to organize everything before jumping into the AI part. I feel like both my writing and coding got a little better today.
