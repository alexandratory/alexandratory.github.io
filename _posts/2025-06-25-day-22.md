  Today, I attended an in-person mini-course focused on refreshing my understanding of deep learning, machine learning, and AI concepts. The session covered key fundamentals such as input layers, hidden layers, and output layers in neural networks. I gained a clearer understanding of how data flows through these layers and how weights and biases influence predictions. This reinforced my knowledge of how AI models are structured and trained to identify patterns.  
  In addition, I continued testing the turbidity sensor. This time, I tested it with orange juice to see how the sensor reacted to a more complex and murky liquid. This experiment deepened my appreciation for how turbidity sensors interact with different materials and their limitations in detecting particle density in liquids like juice.

 While testing the turbidity sensor with orange juice, I ran into issues with getting the code to process the readings accurately. The outputs didn’t reflect the expected turbidity levels, likely due to calibration mismatches or noise in the sensor readings.  
 Orange juice’s unique properties, such as its opacity and pulp, introduced inconsistencies in the readings. The sensor appeared to struggle with distinguishing fine variations in turbidity.  
 Modifying the turbidity code to handle more complex liquids posed a challenge. Identifying where to make changes in the formula to align with real-world results requires further research and testing.

  Attending the mini-course was an excellent opportunity to get a refresher and know my understanding of deep learning. Revisiting the concepts helped me appreciate the structure and function of neural networks, especially when thinking about how these models can be applied to our water quality project.  
  Testing the turbidity sensor with orange juice was both insightful and frustrating. While it highlighted the sensor’s potential, it also exposed the need for precise calibration and careful coding to handle more complex liquids. Today’s challenges reminded me of the importance of persistence and iterative problem-solving in both hardware and AI applications. I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned to improve our project further.
