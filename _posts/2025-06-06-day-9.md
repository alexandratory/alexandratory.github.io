what_i_learned: |
 Today my group and I started the day of doing finshing tocuhes on the group google slides. We wanted to make sure that everything was in order and concise before we went on with the presentation. We came to a group agreement to see who will go first and how we will split everything up. The presentation went really well and we hit the amount of time we wanted the video length to be. So it was a sucsess overall. Then, we had a team meeting so we can make sure the plans are set in motion for next week. We will be getting the materials we need and actally apply our research to them.
blockers: |
  There were no blocker today, we had simple tasks.


reflection: |
  The day went smoothly overall and im glad there were no blockers. On a side note, During break I ran into another group that have been doing simulation testing in our building. It was really fun meeting them and learning from their project. Definitely will be checking out the rest of the building on my break soon. Discussing the course work for next week is giving me more ideas to apply to it. I decided to do more research over the weekend based on the topics and purchases of the following week.
