what_i_learned: |  
   Today, I finally finished my Kaggle course and recieved a certificate. Definitely learned alot from this course and I'm very glad I started it.  I also explored the potential of AI tools that analyze emotions in communication for a mock presesntation, particularly for emailing. I learned how to present a pitch idea that can address critical workplace challenges, especially for neurodivergent individuals who face unique communication barriers.  
   I gained insights into developing a growth strategy, focusing on market penetration, user retention, and inclusivity in product development.  I also learned about the importance of creating accessible solutions that empower underserved groups while benefiting everyone. I worked with a new partner on this pitch idea as a exercise and realized Aligning different perspectives while brainstorming solutions for neurodivergent individuals required extra effort to ensure inclusivity and empathy.  
 It was challenging to distill complex ideas into simple, actionable strategies, especially when addressing both business and social impact goals.

  Achieving the certificate today was definitely a big step and I feel very accomplished. Also, Collaborating with someone who doesn’t share the same views as me was a unique and enlightening experience. While it brought moments of disagreement, it also opened my mind to fresh perspectives. I realized that opposing viewpoints can spark creativity and result in well-rounded solutions.  
  This process reminded me that good products and ideas often happens when different minds come together, challenge assumptions, and focus on a shared goal. Overall, I really enjoyed today and learned the foundation of creating a good product.
