what_i_learned: |  
  Today, I finally finished my Kaggle course and received a certificate. I learned a lot from this course and am very glad I started it.  
  I also explored the potential of AI tools that analyze emotions in communication for a mock presentation, particularly in email interactions. I learned how to pitch an idea that addresses critical workplace challenges, especially for neurodivergent individuals who face unique communication barriers.  
  I gained insights into developing a growth strategy, focusing on market penetration, user retention, and inclusivity in product development.  
  I worked with a new partner on this pitch as an exercise and realized that aligning different perspectives while brainstorming solutions for neurodivergent individuals required extra effort to ensure inclusivity and empathy.  
  It was challenging to distill complex ideas into simple, actionable strategies, especially when addressing both business and social impact goals.

  No blockers.  

reflection: |  
  Achieving the certificate today was a significant step, and I feel very accomplished. Collaborating with someone who doesn’t share the same views as me was a unique and enlightening experience. While it brought moments of disagreement, it also opened my mind to fresh perspectives.  
  I realized that opposing viewpoints can spark creativity and lead to well-rounded solutions. This process reminded me that good products and ideas often happen when different minds come together, challenge assumptions, and focus on a shared goal. Overall, I enjoyed today and learned the foundation of creating a good product.
