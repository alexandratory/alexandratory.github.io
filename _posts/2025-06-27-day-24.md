what_i_learned: |  
  Today, I made significant progress on multiple aspects of the project. We worked on drafting a research paper focused on the applications of AI in water quality monitoring. I contributed by writing sections on the pH sensor’s role in detecting contamination and how turbidity sensors measure water clarity.  
  Our team also practiced delivering a presentation summarizing the project goals, challenges, and progress. This activity helped me refine my ability to communicate technical ideas in a clear and engaging way.  
  I spent time revisiting the turbidity sensor code and brainstorming improvements to handle more complex liquids like orange juice. I also worked on organizing our breadboard setup, ensuring both sensors are securely connected and functional.  
  Additionally, I explored new techniques for integrating the ESP32 with Firebase to enable smoother real-time data uploads. I tested different calibration approaches for the pH sensor, aiming to improve accuracy in varying water conditions.  

blockers: |  
  - Writing concise yet detailed sections required balancing technical depth with readability, which was difficult.  
  - Simplifying technical terms for a non-technical audience while keeping the presentation engaging was tricky.  
  - Despite code adjustments, the sensor still struggles with liquids that have complex properties like pulp or opacity.  
  - Achieving consistent real-time uploads faced interruptions due to occasional connectivity errors.  

reflection: |  
  Today was a productive day filled with both creative and technical work. Writing the research paper helped me connect theoretical knowledge to practical applications, giving me a broader perspective on the project’s impact. Practicing the presentation boosted my confidence in explaining our work and taught me the importance of tailoring content for different audiences.  
  Revisiting the turbidity sensor and breadboard setup reminded me that small improvements can make a big difference in the project’s overall functionality. Despite some persistent challenges, I feel proud of the progress made today and motivated to continue refining our solutions.
