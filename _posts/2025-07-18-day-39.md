what_i_learned: |
  Today we took time to connect with our own group and Team 8 through a bonding trip to the park and beach. It was a nice break from our usual lab environment and gave us space to talk, laugh, and build stronger team dynamics outside of our project roles.

  Once back in the lab, we continued refining key parts of our final paper. We reviewed the methodology and abstract again, looking for ways to better explain our machine learning process and how it ties to the problem we're solving. I helped clean up some language in our literature review to make it more concise and flow better with the rest of the document.

  Some of us also checked our machine learning notebook in Colab to make sure all outputs were accurate and matched the ground truth labels we established earlier in the week.

  We're still working to improve the connections between sections of our paper. Making sure the flow from the literature review into our methodology feels smooth has been tricky. We’re also thinking about how to break down our technical process in a way that’s understandable during our presentation.

reflection: |
  Today showed me how important it is to take time for the people behind the project. The team bonding reminded me how far we’ve come as a group. Now, we’re in the final stretch—just polishing everything and preparing to present our work in the clearest and most compelling way possible.
