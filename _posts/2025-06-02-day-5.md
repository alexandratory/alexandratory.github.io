what_i_learned: |
  I learned deeper about how machine learning works and how RAG is implemeted into it. It's a technique that enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models.  I learned to peel back layers of a research question and how to put a research question into AI and how to get a proper repsonse from it. For my research lab we went over an article thats one of the topics for our project. The topic of the article was Real-Time Monitoring of Water Quality and Detection of Anomalies Arising from Chemical Contamination. Im learned alot nfrom it for my reaserch. I also learned how to work with my group as a team and to figure out problems together through a marshmellow game.
  This helped me better understand how and learn how my team operates and how quick they are with thier thinking.

blockers: |
  The biggest challenge was understanding the concept of RAG and the meaning which is Retrieval-Augmented Generation. I didnt at first understand how it tied in with AI.

reflection: |
  Getting a closer look at my project and meeting my team members was very exciting. I feel more confident in the completion of the project and i hope to get a closer connection with everyone. I definitely have a better understanding of the complications of AI, how Ai thinks and how things are generated based on the discussion this morning.
