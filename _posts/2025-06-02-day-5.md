what_i_learned: |
  I learned deeper about how machine learning works and how RAG is implemented into it. It's a technique that enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models. I learned to peel back layers of a research question, how to put a research question into AI, and how to get a proper response from it. For my research lab, we went over an article that's one of the topics for our project. The topic of the article was Real-Time Monitoring of Water Quality and Detection of Anomalies Arising from Chemical Contamination. In this article, it shows how important it is to monitor water quality. The change in water quality is due to climate change and human development risks. Based on the article, it shows that current water quality monitoring systems are time-intensive and often limited to specific contaminants. Real-time monitoring systems are needed to detect a broader range of pollutants and address risks promptly. It discusses how the tech integrates optical sensors like UV-Vis spectroscopy and fluorescence spectrometry to gather data. 
  I learned a lot from it for my research. I also learned how to work with my group as a team and figure out problems together through a marshmallow game. This helped me better understand my team and learn how quick their thinking is.

blockers: |
  The biggest challenge was understanding the concept of RAG and its meaning, which is Retrieval-Augmented Generation. I didn't at first understand how it tied in with AI.

reflection: |
  Getting a closer look at my project and meeting my team members was very exciting. I feel more confident in the completion of the project, and I hope to get a closer connection with everyone. I definitely have a better understanding of the complications of AI, how AI thinks, and how things are generated based on the discussion this morning.
