  Today was a deep dive into setting up the tools and software we’ll use for our project. I successfully installed Arduino IDE and learned how to integrate ESP32 from the video tutorials, which was particularly helpful in understanding how the microcontroller communicates with external hardware. The Firebase account setup was also straightforward, and it’s exciting to see how we’ll use it to store and manage real-time data.  
  The TinyGPS++ videos expanded my knowledge of GPS modules and their integration with Arduino. These tutorials broke down complex processes into manageable steps, which I’ll apply when working with location-based data in our project. Additionally, I revisited several Arduino tutorials that covered foundational concepts, such as pin configurations and basic programming, which will streamline the data collection process.  
  The workflow we practiced—collecting Arduino data, saving it as .csv files, uploading it to Colab, and training a machine learning model—helped me see the entire pipeline. It gave me confidence in connecting hardware with software and using ML models to analyze real-world data. Our earlier pitch practice also tied everything together, showing how to present our project clearly and effectively.

  While today was productive, I encountered some minor challenges with the TinyGPS++ library installation. It took time to make sure the dependencies were correctly configured in Arduino IDE. Also, when it came to understanding Firebase’s structure, it felt overwhelming initially, but following tutorials step by step helped. Lastly, coordinating between multiple tools like Python, Arduino, and Colab required careful attention to ensure compatibility and data accuracy.

reflection: |  
  Today, I realized how much I’ve grown in balancing theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Installing the software and learning about ESP32, GPS, and Firebase showed how the nature of hardware and software in modern projects. Despite some technical difficulties, overcoming them taught me the importance of persistence and resourcefulness.  
  Practicing the project pitch earlier added another layer of understanding, as I saw how to communicate the value of these tools in solving real problems. I also found it fulfilling to integrate concepts like data collection and machine learning into a coherent workflow. Overall, today reinforced the idea that learning is iterative, and even small steps forward can lead to significant progress in a project.
