what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on finalizing and polishing our research paper using Overleaf. We had a workshop that walked us through how to structure the paper properly, including formatting sections like Abstract, Methodology, Results, and References. I learned how to use LaTeX commands to adjust spacing, align tables, insert figures, and keep everything organized in IEEE format.

  We also spent time searching for a clean, professional way to present our hardware. I explored breadboard enclosures that could fit our full-sized board while still allowing sensors and wires to stick out neatly. This will help us look more prepared on final presentation day.

  Finally, we reviewed our completed methodology section and made final edits based on feedback. It was satisfying to see how far the writing has come. We’re nearly done with our paper, and I now feel confident using Overleaf for technical writing.

blockers: |
  - It took time to find the right type of enclosure that allows wires and sensors to poke through while keeping the breadboard stable and visible.
  - Overleaf formatting (especially with references and tables) required trial and error to get right.
  - It was challenging to decide which figures or diagrams best support our final results.

reflection: |
  Today helped bring both the writing and hardware sides of the project together. It was helpful to work in Overleaf and understand how everything in the research paper connects. It also reminded me that how we present our work—both in writing and hardware—really matters. I feel more prepared for the final presentation now that our paper is almost done and we’re making progress on how the setup will look in person.
