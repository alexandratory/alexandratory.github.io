what_i_learned: |
 Today I learned about Computer vision and they need alot of data and examples to have accurate understand of what they are viewing. I also learned a image classification model using teachable machine. I entered the Python 101 breakout room and learned how Python can convert between int and floats automatically. I learned Type casting which means you convert one datatype to another datatype.
blockers: |
  No blockers were encountered today.
reflection: |
  It was exciting to understand how Git simplifies version control and collaboration!  It was nice learning a image classification model using teachable machine.
