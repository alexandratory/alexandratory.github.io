## What I Learned

Today we focused on preparing for the final project presentation. We created our presentation slides and reviewed how to clearly explain the system and results to a wider audience. Alongside that, we continued debugging the dashboard to ensure it properly reflects the live output from Firebase—matching the sensor readings and AI classification in real time.

On the documentation side, I completed the Overleaf paper, polishing up the methodology, results, and references. I also revisited and verified the core equations used to calculate pH, turbidity, and TDS values, this time excluding the temperature factor to simplify certain edge cases in the sensor data.

## Goals of the Day

- Build clean, informative slides for the final demo presentation
- Debug dashboard connection and match it to Firebase outputs
- Finalize and submit the Overleaf research paper
- Review and simplify water quality equations used for prediction

## Blockers

- The dashboard occasionally displays outdated values due to syncing delays
- Final tuning of Firebase-to-dashboard data format is still in progress
- Minor Overleaf formatting issues took extra time to resolve

## Reflection

We’re right at the finish line. Finalizing the presentation and the paper felt like tying everything together—from hardware to AI to real-time display. While we’re still smoothing out the dashboard syncing, most pieces are in place. Going over the equations helped me reconnect with the core science behind our project and get ready to explain it with clarity and confidence.

Let me know if you want to add links to the Overleaf paper or slide deck. I can also generate a blog version for your teammate Alexes if needed.
