what_i_learned: |
  Today, I deepened my understanding of exploring data manipulation through hands-on practice with Kaggle exercises. I learned how to load datasets using Pandas and inspect their structure using methods like `.columns`, `.head()`, and `.describe()`. 
  It was difficult, but I realized that selecting prediction targets and features to prepare data for machine learning models is key. My team and I fixed missing values using `.dropna()` and learned why cleaning data is crucial for analysis.

  I also improved my problem-solving skills by troubleshooting errors like `AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute`, which helped me better understand how to navigate and work with real-world datasets. My mentor helped a lot with these steps because it was very difficult to understand the concept of manipulating the code, but when I actually applied it, it became simpler.

blockers: |
  - We encountered minor issues while identifying the correct column for the prediction target in the Kaggle dataset due to inconsistencies in column naming.
  - Found it challenging to understand some parts of the Kaggle lessons, especially lesson 4. However, reviewing discussions and examples helped clarify these concepts.

reflection: |
  Reflecting on today’s exercises, I realized how important it is to have a systematic approach to understanding datasets before jumping into modeling. Reading through others’ discussion posts on Kaggle not only broadened my perspective but also provided valuable tips for tackling similar challenges. I gained knowledge into the significance of feature selection and how it influences the outcome of machine learning models. Overall, I feel as though I learned a lot today through Kaggle and my mentor. We discussed how all of this will be implemented in the model in the coming weeks.
