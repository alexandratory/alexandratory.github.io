what_i_learned: |
 Today, I deepened my understanding of exploring data manipulation through hands-on practice with Kaggle exercises. I learned how to load datasets using Pandas and inspect their structure using methods like .columns, .head(), and .describe().
It was difficult but I relaized that select prediction targets features to prepare data for machine learning models. My team and I fixed missing values using .dropna() and learned why cleaning data is crucial for analysis.

I also improved my problem-solving skills by troubleshooting errors like AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute, which helped me better understand how to navigate and work with real-world datasets. My mnetor helped alot with these steps because It was very difficult to undestand the comcept of manipulating the code but when I actally appliked it, it was simple.
blockers: |
  We encountered minor issues while identifying the correct column for the prediction target in the Kaggle dataset due to inconsistencies in column naming.

Found it challenging to understand some parts of the Kaggle lessons, especially lesson 4. However, reviewing discussions and examples helped clarify these concepts.

reflection: |
Reflecting on today’s exercises, I realized how important it is to have a systematic approach to understanding datasets before jumping into modeling. Reading through others’ discussion posts on Kaggle not only broadened my perspective but also provided valuable tips for tackling similar challenges. I gained knowledge into the significance of feature selection and how it influences the outcome of machine learning models. Overall, I feel as though I learned alot today thorugh KAggle and my mentor. We discussed how all of this will be implemented in the model in the coming weeks.
