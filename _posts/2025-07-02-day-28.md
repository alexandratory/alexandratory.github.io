what_i_learned: |
  We did a breif overview important parts of our AI water monitoring project. I revisited the Random Forest algorithm we’re using and how we train it using water sensor data like pH, turbidity, TDS, and temperature.

  I learned how we split the data using `train_test_split` so the computer can learn from part of the data (training) and be tested on the rest (testing). I also got a better understanding of what features and labels are—features are the sensor values, and the label is the prediction like “safe” or “unsafe.”

  I also reviewed how to clean the data using tools like `fillna()` to handle missing values, and how to use `apply(pd.to_numeric)` to make sure all data is in the right number format.

blockers: |
  - Missed hands-on work during the day, so had to ask for help and do some independent review.
  - Some machine learning terms were still a little confusing without visuals or examples at first.

reflection: |
  Catching up helped me feel more confident about how the machine learning part of our project works. I realized that even if I miss a day, I can still understand by reviewing notes, reading code examples, and asking teammates. It’s a good reminder that teamwork and self-learning go hand in hand.
