what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on cleaning up our final paper in Overleaf. I fixed formatting issues, updated the LaTeX structure, and made sure our Methodology section was written clearly so that non-technical readers could understand how our system works from end to end.

  I also learned how to organize external `.tex` files (like methodology.tex) and link them properly in the main Overleaf project using `\input{}`. This made our document easier to manage.

  On the hardware side, I researched presentable breadboard enclosures for our final demo. I looked into modular covers like ProtoStax, which support stacking and leave room for wiring and sensor probes. I figured out how to arrange full-size breadboards side-by-side and how many holes or ports we’d need for our ESP32, power supply, and sensor cables to fit cleanly.

  Lastly, I updated parts of our paper with simpler language and made sure our images were loading properly in the PDF by correcting the path and using proper image formats.

goals_of_the_day: |
  - Clean and finalize the Methodology section of the paper.
  - Fix image errors and LaTeX formatting problems in Overleaf.
  - Make the writing more clear and beginner-friendly.
  - Find and plan for a presentable case to hold our ESP32, sensors, and breadboard.

blockers: |
  - Some figures weren’t showing up in Overleaf due to file path issues or unsupported formats.
  - It was hard to find a breadboard case that fits all our needs (sensor cutouts, USB port access, and compact design).
  - Balancing technical accuracy with simple language in the paper took some time.

reflection: |
  I’m starting to feel the project wrapping up, and I want to make sure we finish strong. Today was about cleaning up and making everything more polished—for the paper, the hardware, and how we present our work. We also took some time to work on the script of our elvator pitch and do some finishing touches. I learned a lot about how visuals and structure affect understanding, and I feel more confident in how we’ll explain our project to others. I’m excited to see it all come together soon.
