what_i_learned: |
  Today, my group and I focused on breaking down each line of code used to monitor and control the Arduino-connected sensors. We analyzed how the pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and temperature sensor collect and process data from analog pins, and how the fan, heater, relay, and LCD are controlled via digital pins. This gave us a deeper understanding of how sensor data can be read and translated into outputs.

  After the code review, we explored how to connect the Arduino to our computers through USB and use Python to visualize the sensor data in real-time. This helped us understand serial communication and how we can leverage Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib to monitor trends over time.

  I decided to use Google Colab to simulate sensor data and apply machine learning. We used the Random Forest Classifier to predict whether the water quality is safe or unsafe based on simulated pH, temperature, and turbidity values. It was exciting to see how the model performed and make predictions on new data.

  There were no blcokers while configuring the Arduino with our devices.

  Breaking down the code and simulating the sensors' functionality gave me a much clearer picture of how the components work together. It was interesting to see our code and actions become visual through Python plots and machine learning predictions. Exploring these concepts not only enhanced my technical skills but also boosted my confidence in applying knowledge and all that ive learned to problems. I look forward to testing the model on real sensor data in the coming days.
