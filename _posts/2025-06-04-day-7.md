what_i_learned: |
  To start off we pracriced our research skills by finding datasets of the quality of water for 5 states. There was several websites that had the datasets and i learned to click csv or pdf to get clerar results from the websites. I also leanred alot about how there are different programs and community gathering to test the quality of water in each area. They test the PH level and water temp, those were the most common to be tested. I also learned more about the importance of water quality to each state. Then we started asking hypothetical question like What if the AI or robot messes up the water quality tester and gives the wrong output or no output?
The reasoning would be that the AI's results are due to poorly designed interfaces or insufficient training. The solution to figure out the root cause is to input more data. Use the error for research and improve it. This is important because Incorrect readings could result in unsafe water being deemed safe or vice versa. We could face legal consequences for using faulty data.
To fix this we can also use multiple sensors and make sure they all get the same accurate result. My team and I could also implement and Design the system to flag the errors and give us verification when there is alot uncertainty. We leanred alot about the structure and look of our product. There was a video that explained the trial in good detail and i got the grasp of everything.




blockers: |
There was suprisingly no blockers when it came to the research or understanding of the video.

reflection: |
  Seeing the model in action in the video was really good to see. It helped me invision what the final product will look like and im glad I saw the video because it made me more inspired and gave really good ideas. Although, Todays research was not as engaging as the other days. Ive learned alot but it wasnt like I could apply it to anything yet. Maybe I'm being impatient. Didnt think I would learn more about my teams work ethic but I did and it was really interesting to see. Can't wait to go mroe into depth with this project and everything we leanred so far.
