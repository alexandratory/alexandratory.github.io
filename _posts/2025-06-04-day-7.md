what_i_learned: |
  To start off, we practiced our research skills by finding datasets on water quality for five states. There were several websites with the datasets, and I learned to click CSV or PDF formats to get clearer results from the websites. I also learned a lot about the different programs and community efforts for testing water quality in each area. They commonly test for pH levels and water temperature. 

  Additionally, I learned more about the importance of water quality to each state. Then we started asking hypothetical questions like, "What if the AI or robot messes up the water quality tester and gives the wrong output or no output?" The reasoning for such errors could be poorly designed interfaces or insufficient training. To address this, we would identify the root cause by inputting more data, using the error for research, and improving the system. This is crucial because incorrect readings could result in unsafe water being deemed safe or vice versa. Legal consequences could arise from using faulty data.

  To mitigate this, we can also use multiple sensors to ensure they all produce accurate results. My team and I could design the system to flag errors and provide verification when there is a lot of uncertainty. We also learned a lot about the structure and appearance of our product. There was a video explaining the trial in great detail, and I grasped everything well.

  Surprisingly, there were no blockers during the research or while understanding the video.

reflection: |
  Seeing the model in action in the video was really helpful. It allowed me to envision what the final product might look like, and I’m glad I saw it because it inspired me and provided some excellent ideas. However, today’s research was not as engaging as the other days. While I learned a lot, it wasn’t something I could immediately apply. Maybe I’m being impatient. I didn’t think I’d learn more about my team’s work ethic, but I did, and it was interesting to observe. I can’t wait to dive deeper into this project and everything we’ve learned so far.
