what_i_learned: |
  We began the day with a campus tour, learning about different buildings and how it represents the University. There is alot of research groups and building that I didnt know were here. I would love to check it out next semester. We also delved deeper into identifying sources of drinking water, such as rivers, reservoirs, springs, and wells. These sources can carry naturally occurring minerals, radioactive materials, and contaminants introduced through animal or human activity.  

  A takeaway was the importance of researching microbial contaminants, such as E. coli, which signal potential water contamination by human or animal waste. Understanding these contaminants is crucial, as they impact both human and animal health.  

  Another learning point was becoming familiar with the tools and technologies that will be used for our water quality detection system. Additionally, we brainstormed various hypothetical scenarios and developed questions to refine our research approach and solutions.

  There were no blockers during the research or while creating the slides.

reflection: |
  First, I want to say that it was a really enjoyable experience exploring the campus after a while and learning more about the buildings. I had a great time meeting more of my peers and felt more comfortable getting to know them. Completing the presentation slides with my team was a breeze. Everyone contributed such good ideas for the text and design of the presentation. We collaborated so well, which I think will be a great strength during the final presentation.
