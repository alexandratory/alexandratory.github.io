what_i_learned: |
  Today, my team and I did extensive research on a microcontroller board used to program and control electronic circuits. It communicates with sensors and outputs data. We read a detailed article explaining connections using the breadboard and Arduino. A breadboard is a reusable platform for connecting components and wiring circuits without soldering. It has rows and columns of connected pins. The article explains the troubleshooting process and the challenges faced, which we could learn from. It prepared us for potential mistakes or problems. By experimenting with these connections and coding, we became more comfortable with Arduino and breadboard setups. Then we implemented everything we learned into Tinkercad. TinkerCAD helps us simulate circuits without physical components. Working on this with my team was surprisingly easy; we all understood it quite well. Soon, we will apply the articles and videos about Arduino to real-life components, which is exciting.

  There were no blockers during the research or while practicing with TinkerCAD.

  First, I want to say that it was a really enjoyable experience exploring the TinkerCAD website. I learned so much about Arduino, breadboards, and components like LEDs and potentiometers. I now understand how to connect everything to the breadboard. We can organize our circuit neatly and avoid direct, messy connections to the Arduino. I can apply this knowledge when we receive the components in person tomorrow.
