what_i_learned: |
  Today, started off pretty fun from the usual. We did cohort connect like every thursday and did some bonding games. It was really fun to see how competitve everyone was and I got to know everyone a little better. My team decided to go over the topics we will discuss in out presentation. We went over what we did this week and organized it. We also talked about what we struggled with during the week. Then we started adding what will be said on the presentation video.

  We encountered minor issues while configuring the Arduino with our respective devices, especially finding the correct COM port on different operating systems. These were resolved with guidance from the team.

reflection: |
  Today was a nice change of pace with the cohort activities. The bonding games brought a lighthearted energy to the day and allowed me to connect with my peers on a more personal level. It was great to see everyone's competitive spirit.  

  Reflecting on the week's progress during the team discussion was insightful and showed what we needed to work on. Revisiting our struggles, especially with Arduino configurations, highlighted how much we've grown in troubleshooting and problem-solving. Organizing our presentation also gave clarity about what we’ve achieved so far.  

  Overall, it was a productive and engaging day, because there was teamwork, creativity, and fun. I’m feeling more confident about the presentation and excited to share our progress with the larger group.
