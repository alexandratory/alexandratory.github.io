what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned about different learning styles using the VARK model: Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic. I found out that I’m a Visual and Kinesthetic learner, which means I understand things best when I see diagrams or do hands-on activities. This helped me a lot when working with the breadboard wiring, sensor setup, and organizing our ESP32 connections.

  We discussed how our learning styles affect how we contribute to the project. I focus best when I’m building and organizing, while my teammates are stronger at writing and coding through reading and discussion. Knowing this helped us divide work better and avoid misunderstandings.

  We also reviewed how these strengths helped us build the Firebase dashboard, test sensors, create the UI with Tailwind, and explain our project in a way people can understand. It made me realize how everyone brings something valuable to the team.

blockers: |
  Sometimes it’s hard to work at the same pace since I like clear plans and others prefer flexibility.
  We had moments where too many creative ideas were happening at once and it got hard to stay focused.
  Some team members like to talk things out while others prefer to write, so we needed to find a balance in communication.

reflection: |
  Understanding our learning styles helped our team work better together. I now know how to play to my strengths and also support others in how they learn. I feel more confident in what I bring to the team. Creating this awareness helped us plan smarter, reduce stress, and build stronger trust within the group.
  
  I also feel like I can explain what I’m doing better now, which is important for our final presentation. Our different personalities and styles are actually a good mix when we respect and organize them.
