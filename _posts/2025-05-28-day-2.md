what_i_learned: |
  I refreshed my knowledge of Python basics, including simple commands like `print("Hello, World!")`. The `print` function is fundamental in Python and is used to display output on the screen. I also got a refresher on the concept of strings, which are a data type in Python. Strings are used to represent text and are denoted by either single or double quotation marks. Understanding these basics is crucial as they form the foundation for more complex programming concepts. Alongside these basics, I started to understand how Python handles data types. This included recognizing the significance of strings and their role in programming, such as storing and manipulating text data. It was exciting to see how simple commands could lead to a big cnage and interactions in code.

  Overall, I think working with these platforms will be both enjoyable and rewarding. The mentors that helped out were really good at explaining and answered my questions effectively. They offer opportunities to enhance my programming skills and gain experience with tools that are widely used in the tech industry. I look forward to deepening my understanding of Python and learning how to leverage Replit and GitHub effectively. This experience has made me optimistic about the journey ahead, and I’m excited to see how my skills will evolve over time.
