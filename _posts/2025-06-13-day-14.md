what_i_learned: |
 We started off by getting a in person view of some more tools for the water contamination project. Our mentor described and labeled each of the tool needed. Right now, We are currently still waiting on the adrino. Overall, we are ready to get started with assembling everything together like we did virtually. We also did a kaggle course today that was offered by my professor. I got a overview of how machine learning models work and how they are used.  My team and I completed our video presentation for the end of the week. I think it was a really good recap.

reflection: |
  Today was a more focused day. The professor and mentor explaining the equipment they have worked with was very intersting and had me locked in. I learned alot more today especailly with using kaggle and cant wait to apply it to the future model. Adding my own ideas and design will be very interesting.
