what_i_learned: |  
  Today, I focused on reviewing the turbidity sensor code to identify areas for improvement. While I didn’t run new tests, I carefully analyzed how the code handles input readings and converts them to turbidity values. This review helped me spot potential calibration mismatches and areas where the formula could be fine-tuned to accommodate liquids like orange juice.  
  I also revisited documentation for the turbidity sensor and the ESP32 to ensure I fully understood their specifications. Preparing for the next round of testing, I made notes on how to isolate environmental factors like light interference and how to test with a variety of liquid samples.  
  Additionally, I brainstormed ideas for integrating the turbidity sensor data with Firebase to create a seamless flow from data collection to visualization.

blockers: |  
  - Although I made progress on reviewing the code, I didn’t have the opportunity to test the changes in real-time. This limited my ability to confirm whether the adjustments would improve sensor accuracy.  
  - Understanding how to generalize the turbidity formula for different types of liquids remains a challenge. Further reading and experimentation are needed to refine this aspect.  
  - There were minor logistical interruptions, which slowed down the pace of hands-on progress.  

reflection: |  
  Even though today was less hands-on, I found value in stepping back to review and plan. Analyzing the code in detail allowed me to approach the turbidity sensor issue with a clearer strategy, which I’m confident will pay off in the next round of testing.  
  Revisiting the technical documentation helped solidify my understanding of how the sensor and ESP32 function together. This knowledge is crucial for building a robust system. While today’s progress felt slower, it reminded me that thorough planning and preparation are as important as active testing. Tomorrow, I plan to implement and test the changes I worked on today.
