  Today, my team and I created a schedule for the final weeks before our presentation. We talked about how to stay organized and give everyone a time limit for presenting each part. This helped us feel more ready and focused on what still needs to be done.

  We also learned how to connect our ESP32 board to WiFi and send sensor data to Firebase. We used sample code to enter our WiFi name and password and set up the Firebase host and key. Then we learned how to define sensor pins for TDS, pH, and turbidity, so the board knows where each sensor is connected.

  In the code, we set up variables to hold the sensor readings and added calibration numbers to help improve accuracy. The reading interval was set to 30 seconds, which means the board waits 30 seconds before collecting and sending new data. Seeing it work showed how our water quality readings can go directly to a database online in real time.

  At first, it was confusing to know where to put the WiFi and Firebase details in the code. It also took a few tries to get all the sensor pins connected right. We had to make sure the Firebase host and token were correct or the upload wouldn’t work.

reflection: |
  Today was a helpful day because we started preparing for the final presentation and made sure our system could upload data live. I learned how the code connects everything together — from the sensors to Firebase. It’s cool to see how all the pieces work. Planning ahead also made me feel more confident about what’s left to finish.
